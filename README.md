# 🎰 Modern Slot Machine Game

A sleek, modern web-based slot machine game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project transforms a simple terminal-based Node.js game into a visually engaging browser experience with a dark-mode, glassmorphism-inspired UI and dynamic animations.

## ✨ Features

* **Modern & Responsive UI**: A beautiful dark-mode interface inspired by glassmorphism.

* **Dynamic Animations**: Features a swirling background and celebratory confetti on wins.

* **Core Slot Machine Logic**: Deposit funds, place bets on 1-3 lines, and spin the reels.

* **Lightweight**: Built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, requiring no frameworks.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Web Version (Recommended)

Getting the modern version running on your local machine is simple.

1. **Download the files:**

   * Download `index.html`, `style.css`, and `project.js` and place them all in the same folder.

2. **Open in your browser:**

   * Navigate to the folder where you saved the files.

   * Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Original Node.js Terminal Version

If you wish to run the original terminal-based game:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```

npm install

```

3. **Run the Game**: Start the game by running:

```

node project.js

```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the core structure of the web application.

* **CSS3**: For all styling, including the modern layout and animations.

* **Vanilla JavaScript**: For all game logic in both the web and Node.js versions.

* **Canvas Confetti**: A library used for the winning confetti animation in the web version.

* **Node.js**: Powers the original terminal-based version of the game.
